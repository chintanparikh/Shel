{"name":"Shel","body":"# Shel\r\n\r\n## What is Shel?\r\n\r\nShel is an extremely simple and lightweight blogging platform with a few core principles in mind. Primarily, blogging should be about the content, and bloggers shouldn't be focusing on the presentation. Shel allows you to write a blog in any format you choose, as long as there's a translator available for it (markdown is included by default). If not, write your own - it's extremely simple. \r\n\r\nShel was heavily inspired by static site generators such as Jekyll. As a result, all posts are single page files. However, unlike static site generators, you don't need to run a program before uploading anything, you simply upload your file (in whichever format you prefer), suffix it with .shel, and Shel takes care of the rest.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nClone this repository (or download and upload) to your webserver, and change the last two settings in /config/config.ini\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nBy default, Shel comes with Markdown support. To get started, upload a post to /posts written in Markdown format. The filename should be structured as follows: date-title.shel. The date should be in the format DD-MM-YYYY. For example 20-02-2012-Hello.shel. Your post should be entirely content (don't include the title, that's done automatically based off the filename).\r\n\r\n## Creating a new translator\r\nA translator converts a post into HTML. All translators are stored in /translators and must implement the interface Translator (which just states that they must contain the public method translate). The structure of /translators is as follows:\r\n\r\n    /translators\r\n      /translatorname\r\n        translatorname.php\r\n      translator.php\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is easiest seen by taking a look inside /translators at the default Markdown translator.\r\n\r\n## To do list (feel free to contribute!):\r\n* Exceptions + exception handling (currently no errors, etc are thrown)\r\n* Add support for comments (possibly via disqus)\r\n* Automatic testing (PHPUnit?)\r\n* Refactor the code (currently quite messy, it's a functioning first iteration)\r\n  * The monolithic Shel class needs to be removed and replaced with classes that make more sense\r\n* Add support for components/addons - navigation will be moved into a component\r\n\r\n## A note on comments in the source code\r\nOccasionally while looking through the source code, you'll see perl style comments. These comments are essentially a mini todo list inside the source code, so if you see them, feel free to fork and sort it out!","tagline":"A super simple flat file blogging engine","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
