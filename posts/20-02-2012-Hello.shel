#Hello

Welcome to Shel, my super simple flat file blogging engine.

It currently only supports Markdown, but it is soon to support many more formats! It uses highlight.js for syntax highlighting!

##Example:

	abstract class Model
	{
		protected $load, $config;

		function __construct(Load $load, Config $config)
		{
			$this->load = $load;
			$this->config = $config;
		}
	}
